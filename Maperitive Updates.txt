To make Maperitive MBTiles work or Update Cube Tiles:

1. Install and Open Maperitive.
2. Find and set a map that you wish to use, it defaults to OSM Bright, but anything will work.
3. Zoom to the location you want, the visible area is what will be rendered.
4. In the command line on Maperitive, type [generate-mbtiles minzoom=0 maxzoom=19]
5. Wait, this will take a few hours, or even overnight. 
	You can do a smaller zoom (smaller "maxzoom" number),
	but the images will be at a much lower quality as you get closer in Cube.
6. When complete, upload the data to github repository:
	cd to:
		 /c/Maperitive-latest/Maperitive/Tiles
	type [git init -b main]
	type [git add .]
	type [git commit -m "commitName"]
	type [git remote add origin https://github.com/cityofkokomo/HowardCoMbtiles.git]
	type [git remote -v] to verify
	type [git push origin main -f] (with force!)

7. When complete, clone the github repository into the server
	cd to:
		/opt/maps
	delete prior repository [sudo rm HowardCoMbtiles -r]
	clone new repository [sudo git clone https://github.com/cityofkokomo/HowardCoMbtiles.git]
	cd to:
		/opt/maps/HowardCoMbtiles
8. When complete, run docker:
	docker run --rm -it -v$(pwd):/data -p 10001:80 maptiler/tileserver-gl
9. If docker was previously running, this will not work. 
	-Run: docker ps
	-Once you see the id of the currently running docker, use the following to stop it:
		docker stop [insert docker id]
10. Once you have done this, return to step 8.



It is common to see the following error:

	"WARN: MBTiles not in "openmaptiles" format. Serving raw data only..."

This is okay and will not effect the server.
